# RestaurantSite 3

Created a Restaurant Website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Made the homepage with the help of bootstrap to show the jumbotron announcing that a new location was opening and a carousel showing the drink special, annoucement of a new opening, and that a seasonal menu will be rolling out. The menu was used the bootstrap grid system and had a table built with the prices of drinks. The contact us page was built out in a form and used JavaScript to validate and send the request by clicking the send request button.
